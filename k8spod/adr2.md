## Decision

We will use OpenShift to dynamically provision Jenkins agent pods using the Kubernetes plugin, allowing scalability, isolation, and native integration with OpenShift. Agent configurations will be defined via JCasC and/or pipeline-level pod templates.

Additionally, to support workloads that require Kerberos authentication, the following design pattern will be used within the agent pod:

### Kerberos Authentication Flow via Init Container

Some jobs require Kerberos authentication. To support this securely within Jenkins agent pods, we adopt the following approach:

- A **Base64-encoded keytab file** is stored as a Jenkins credential (Secret Text or File).
- The pod template includes an **`initContainer`** which:
  - Reads the keytab from an environment variable or secret mount.
  - Runs `kinit` using a specialized Kerberos-enabled image.
  - Stores the resulting **TGT cache** in a **shared `emptyDir` volume**.
- The **main application container** shares the same volume, so it can access the Kerberos ticket without managing authentication directly.

This pattern ensures the ticket is available for secure operations (e.g., `curl --negotiate` or `hdfs dfs`) in the application container.

---

### Components Involved

- **Jenkins Master**: Orchestrates job execution and provisions agent pods.
- **Kubernetes Cluster (OpenShift)**: Manages pod lifecycle.
- **Jenkins Agent Pod**: A dynamic pod created per job, composed of:
  - `initContainer` for Kerberos setup
  - JNLP container (Jenkins connectivity)
  - App container (job logic)
  - Shared volume (`emptyDir`) for TGT

### ðŸ”„ Lifecycle Flow

#### Pod Provisioning
- Jenkins requests a pod using a defined template.
- Kubernetes acknowledges and begins creating the pod.

#### Authentication Setup
- Init container:
  - Decodes keytab from Jenkins credentials
  - Runs `kinit`
  - Writes TGT to shared volume
- Init container then terminates.

#### Main Container Start
- JNLP connects to Jenkins master
- App container starts and uses the TGT from shared volume

#### Job Execution
- Jenkins sends job steps to the app container
- App uses the Kerberos ticket for secure operations

#### Teardown
- Jenkins signals the pod to terminate
- Kubernetes deletes all containers and the pod itself
