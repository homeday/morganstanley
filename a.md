# Jenkins Architecture Documentation

## Context:

In the current software development landscape, delivering high-quality applications rapidly and efficiently is paramount. CI/CD practices have become essential to achieve this goal, enabling teams to automate the building, testing, and deployment of code changes.â€‹
## Decision:

To implement effective CI/CD pipelines, we have chosen Jenkins as our automation server. Jenkins is an open-source tool renowned for its extensibility and robust plugin ecosystem, offering over 1,000 plugins that significantly extend its core functionality. By leveraging Jenkins, we aim to streamline our development workflows, reduce manual errors, and accelerate our release cycle.â€‹

## System Components

### Jenkins Controller

The Jenkins Controller is the central orchestrator of the CI/CD pipeline. Its responsibilities include:

- **Job Scheduling:** Managing and triggering build jobs based on predefined criteria.
- **Plugin Management:** Extending Jenkins functionalities through various plugins.
- **Resource Allocation:** Assigning tasks to appropriate agents based on availability and capability.

In our setup, the Jenkins Controller comprises:

- **Active Node:** The primary instance handling all operations.
- **Standby Node:** A failover instance ensuring high availability.

### Agents

Agents are responsible for executing real tasks assigned by the Jenkins Master. We have categorized them as:

- **BYOA Agent:** Users can register their own VMs to be as Jenkins agents.
- **MSDE Agent:** The Agents which are provided by MSDE.
- **CKS Pod Agent:** Runs tasks within CKS pods

### External Services

Our Jenkins environment interacts with several external services:

- **BitBucket:** Source code repository triggering builds via webhooks.
- **NAS:** Stores Jenkins controller configure data and logs.
- **Artifactory:** Manages binary artifacts, serving as a repository for build outputs.
- **Jenkins QA:** QA instance for testing plugins and updates.
- **Update Center:** Provides updates and plugins for Jenkins (internet).

### User Interaction

Users interact with the system through:

- **JSM:** Users can open a ticket to add their own VMs as Jenkins Agents (BYOA).
- **Train Application:** Application for creating/modifying/deleting Jenkins jobs.
- **UI Portal:** Users can view the results of their Jenkins jobs and add credentials via it.

Consequence
Adopting Jenkins as our CI/CD platform provides a flexible and extensible foundation for automating software delivery. Its robust plugin ecosystem supports integration with a wide range of tools, enabling teams to build, test, and deploy code efficiently across different environments.

The architecture, with an active-standby controller setup, supports high availability and operational resilience. Multiple agent types (BYOA, MSDE, CKS) offer scalability and adaptability to various team requirements and infrastructure setups. Integration with external systems like BitBucket, Artifactory, and NAS ensures a smooth flow of code, artifacts, and logs across the pipeline.

This decision also introduces a need for ongoing maintenance of Jenkins components, plugin management, and operational oversight to ensure consistent performance and security. With proper governance and monitoring in place, this architecture positions the organization to deliver software quickly, reliably, and at scale.


 

Consume Your Own Shared Library in Jenkins

Besides using the MSDE Train Shared Libraries, users can also create their own shared libraries, push them to Bitbucket, and load them into their Jenkins pipelines using the customLibrary method.

1. Writing Your Own Shared Library

For general guidance on how to create a Jenkins shared library, please refer to the following documentation:
ðŸ‘‰ How to Write a Shared Library

2. Example: Creating a Custom Helper

Hereâ€™s an example of a simple custom shared library function that prepares a Python virtual environment.

Create a Groovy file named withPyEnvConfig.groovy and add it to the vars folder in your repository.

def call(def body) {
    sh '''
        set -eux
        python3 -m venv .venv
        ./.venv/bin/activate
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    '''
    withEnv([
        "VIRTUAL_ENV=${env.WORKSPACE}/.venv",
        "PATH=${env.WORKSPACE}/.venv/bin:${env.PATH}"
    ]) {
        body()
    }
}


This function creates a Python virtual environment, activates it, and ensures pip is up to date.
Then, it executes the provided pipeline body (body) within that environment.

3. Loading Your Custom Library

To load your custom shared library, use the customLibrary function in your pipeline script.
For example:

customLibrary(projectName: 'bbProj', repoName: 'repoName')

pipeline {
    stages {
        stage("Build") {
            steps {
                withPyEnvConfig {
                    // Your build steps here
                }
            }
        }
    }
}


This example demonstrates how the custom function withPyEnvConfig can be called directly in your pipeline once your shared library is loaded.

âœ… Summary

You can host your shared library in Bitbucket.

Add custom Groovy files under the vars/ directory.

Use customLibrary to load your library in Jenkins pipelines.



import com.cloudbees.jenkins.plugins.bitbucket.server.BitbucketServerConfiguration
import com.cloudbees.jenkins.plugins.bitbucket.endpoints.BitbucketEndpointConfiguration

// get all Bitbucket Server configurations
def configs = BitbucketServerConfiguration.all()
configs.each { cfg ->
    println "Name: ${cfg.name}, ID: ${cfg.id}"
}

// or find one by name
def targetName = "my-bitbucket-server"
def target = configs.find { it.name == targetName }

if (target) {
    println "Found '${targetName}' with ID: ${target.id}"
} else {
    println "No Bitbucket Server configuration named '${targetName}' found."
}
