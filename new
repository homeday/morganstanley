Field	Controls	Common Use Case	Typical Setting in OpenShift
fsGroup	Group ID for volume ownership	Shared volumes, PVCs	MustRunAsRange
supplementalGroups	Additional GIDs for container	Shared resources, file access	RunAsAny or MustRunAsRange
seLinuxContext	SELinux label context	Namespace isolation, RHEL hardening	MustRunAs or MustRunAsRange

ðŸ’¡ In Practice
OpenShiftâ€™s restricted SCC (the default for unprivileged pods) uses:

runAsUser: MustRunAsRange

fsGroup: MustRunAsRange

supplementalGroups: RunAsAny

seLinuxContext: MustRunAs

This ensures:

Pods run with UIDs and GIDs in a project-specific range.

SELinux labels isolate namespaces.

Volumes are owned by appropriate group IDs.
